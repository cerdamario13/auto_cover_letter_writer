# auto_cover_letter_writer
Automate the cover letter writing process as much as possible
<br>
The first step is to find a location in google drive to start the project. Once you have the folder location, create a new google sheets file.
<br>
You can download the sheet I am using [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGqwUjMVLTQedyrGmLZlXKfUwMOnNGS5uMI8WInHDUA/copy)
<br>
Once you have the sheet, go to the top menu and click on **Extensions**, in here click **App Script**. This will take you to Google App Sript page. Copy and paste the code that is found in **main.js**.
<br>
**Note:** in order for the code to work. Permission needs to be granted. This is what it will look like.
